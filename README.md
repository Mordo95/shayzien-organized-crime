# Shayzien Organised Crime

Full credits go to [Dylan Lange](https://github.com/DylanLange/shayzien-organised-crime) but due to the repository being stale and the owner is not replying to comments or PR requests for over a year, I forked it over to continue to support this plugin.

As you hop worlds and read the information board by Captain Ginea, this plugin will keep track of the locations and estimated times for gangs appearing.

### Features

- Click on the buttons to quick-hop to the world.
- Shows the wiki images which indicate the location on the map.
- Automatically cull stale entries which are more than 5 minutes old

### How to use

#### Installing

Make sure you've installed this plugin from the RuneLite plugin hub, and enabled it in your client. See [here](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Information-about-the-Plugin-Hub) for information on how to install plugins from the plugin hub.

After it's installed, you should be able to enable it by searching your plugins for "Organised crime".
After that, you can choose which locations the plugin keeps track of.
